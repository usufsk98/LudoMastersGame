/// <summary>
/// Implements OnClick to destroy the GameObject it's attached to. Optionally a RPC is sent to do this.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Using an RPC to Destroy a GameObject allows any player to Destroy a GameObject. But it might cause errors.
/// RPC and the Instantiated GameObject are not fully linked on the server. One might stick in the server witout
/// the other.
///
/// A buffered RPC gets cleaned up when the sending player leaves the room. This means, the RPC gets lost.
///
/// Vice versus, a GameObject Instantiate might get cleaned up when the creating player leaves a room.
/// This way, the GameObject that a RPC targets might become lost.
///
/// It makes sense to test those cases. Many are not breaking errors and you just have to be aware of them.
///
/// Gets OnClick() calls by InputToEvent class attached to a camera.
